# MathSLM: A Transformer-Based Small Language Model for Mathematical Reasoning.

## 1. Project Overview

**MathSLM** is a Transformer-based Small Language Model designed for mathematical reasoning. The project aims to develop a lightweight and computationally efficient language model capable of understanding mathematical problems and generating step-by-step solutions.

Large Language Models can perform mathematical problem solving effectively, but their computational requirements and deployment costs can make them unsuitable for resource-constrained educational environments. MathSLM addresses this challenge by developing a smaller, domain-focused language model for mathematical reasoning.

The proposed system uses a **decoder-only Transformer architecture** implemented using the **PyTorch** deep learning framework. The model is trained on publicly available mathematical reasoning datasets and learns mathematical patterns through next-token prediction. It is designed to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final mathematical answer.

## 4. Abstract

Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental capability required in educational systems, scientific computing, and intelligent tutoring applications. While large language models have demonstrated strong performance on mathematical problem solving, their high computational requirements and deployment costs make them unsuitable for many educational and resource-constrained environments.

MathSLM proposes a lightweight Transformer-based framework designed to understand, reason, and generate step-by-step solutions for mathematical problems while maintaining computational efficiency.

The proposed system implements a decoder-only Transformer architecture using the PyTorch deep learning framework and trains it on publicly available mathematical reasoning datasets. The framework performs data preprocessing, tokenization, sequence preparation, Transformer-based language modeling, supervised training, and autoregressive text generation.

The model learns mathematical patterns through next-token prediction and generates intermediate reasoning steps before producing the final answer. Configurable generation strategies including greedy decoding, temperature sampling, and top-k sampling are incorporated during inference.

A web-based interface enables users to enter mathematical queries and interact with the trained model in real time. The system is evaluated using training and validation loss, perplexity, token prediction accuracy, benchmark evaluation, and qualitative analysis of generated solutions.
